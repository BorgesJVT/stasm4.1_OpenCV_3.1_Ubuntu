# stasm4.1_OpenCV_3.1_Ubuntu

This repository is based on Juan Cardelino repo https://github.com/juan-cardelino/stasm.
I did just a few modifications to allow Stasm work with OpenCV 3.1.

To install Stasm 4.1 you need just OpenCV properly installed in your machine.
After that, execute the following command on your terminal:

./build.sh

I've changed the external directory from Juan Cardelino and used a realtime stasm
processing as code example.
